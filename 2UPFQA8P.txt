** My Favorite Fruit**

In short my favorite fruit is a *green apple*. 

I enjoy green apples the most due to there sour taste and there crunch when being bitten into. 
They are used when making apple pie and most other apple pastries. although these are good reasons to like a fruit, my main reason behind loving green apples is that my family hates them. Meaning that they wont eat my apples, and that makes me happy.
